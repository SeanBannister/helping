## Installation

## Usage

Each function should be imported individually.

```

## Documentation

## Todo

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Please fix bugs or make improvements to existing code. I might be reluctant to add new features as this project was mostly developed to meet my own needs but feel free to open an issue to discuss.
